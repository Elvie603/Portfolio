                               “Hi I’m Elvie, 25 years old. BSIT student in STI Global City.  Currently working as a service 
							   support in BGC Fort Bonifacio. I enjoy the responsibilities of working. I’ll get such a great 
							   feel for what customers need and want. Being a working student is hard just to provide my needs 
							   specially tuition fee. Working hard sometimes leads to over commitment and can result in the 
							   fear of losing the game. Sometimes are stressed to complete the task the given time. Balancing
							   work and school errands are tiring. I start my day as early as possible and may even feel 
							   that the hours devoted aren’t enough.
                            </p>

                    </div>
                            <p>
                               As a working student I usually goes to bed tired from the long list of errands that need to finish. I choose Bachelor of Science in Information 
							   Technology because I want to fulfill an area of concentration in Information Technology. Because it focuses the application of computers and computer 
							   software to manage information systems to meet the needs of industry and government. I want also to concentrate on Information
							   Technology knowledge including communications, computer networking and website development. 
							   These  concentrations provides me with the competencies necessary to plan, customize and manage 
							   secure network and operating systems configurations for optimum business applications.
